  description: Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great
    coffee shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of
    our beans directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part
    of the profits are reinvested in their communities.

description: Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn
  about their java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
  production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
  knowledge to anyone.
