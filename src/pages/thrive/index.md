Are you struggling to accept a childless life?
Are you looking to find renewed meaning and purpose in a life without children?
Do you want to create a fulfilling and joyful future?
Would you like to feel supported and not alone on this journey?
I’ve been there and can help
Following my own experience of being childless not by choice, I’ve made it my purpose to transform other childless women’s experience of themselves as “not enough”. That’s why I have created the 6 monthThrive coaching program. I have been in your shoes and I offer understanding, care and support.
Together we can create you a joyous present and future
I want all childless women, living a life they didn’t imagine, to see themselves as courageous and unlimited, with the freedom to create a joyous present and future.
Over six months, as your personal coach, I will help you on your journey towards accepting and valuing yourself and creating new meaning and purpose in your life. Whatever this looks like for you, it will be a supportive, safe and nurturing space, holding you at its heart.
More details:
My underpinning beliefs, which inform my coaching practice, are that we all have potential within us, and we have self-determination. I believe that culturally constructed knowledge and values can be challenged, and new meaning made – leading to a shift in outlook and actions. This way I believe transformation is possible.
If, after the free discovery session, we decide to work together, in the first Thrive session we will explore where you are in your journey, the issues affecting you, and where you would like to get to. I will be supportive and empathetic, taking responsibility for building our relationship and the trust between us. You will be the centre of the coaching journey.
Based on what I learn during the exploration session, I will develop some yoga-based practices to support you on your journey. These may include daily meditation and breathing practices to help with stress, anxiety, and self-compassion.
I will also begin each coaching session with a meditation practice, as preparation to help clear the busy chatter of the mind, and enable focus, clarity and presence during the coaching session to enhance your insights, learning and development.
In the coaching sessions, we will explore acceptance of where you currently are, and look at transforming what we can on the road ahead. We can discover different perspectives and options for a life without children, and this may involve challenging existing beliefs holding you back e.g. societal constructs and your own personal narrative. Together we will create actionable steps towards achievable goals, and the client’s your vision for your future.  
Finding your ‘what next’ in a life without children
Coaching will help you regain your confidence and motivation as together we look at where you are in life, and explore different perspectives and options to help you create a new path forward. Combining coaching with my work as a yoga teacher, I create effective nurturing strategies for both mind and body. The goal is to enable you to live a rewarding life, with optimism and joy.
