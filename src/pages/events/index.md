Weekend retreat for childless women \[Change text as below, keep the existing image next to this section]
As featured in the British Wheel of Yoga Spectrum magazine, my childless yoga and wellbeing retreats offer a safe space for childless women to come together to recover from the grief of childlessness and rediscover a sense of joy and purpose.<br /><br />

Taught entirely by childless women, and in the company of other childless women, you will be nurtured body and soul in the beautiful setting of The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire.<br /><br />

The next retreat is being held on 17th to 19th September 2021. The weekend of healing and rejuvenation includes:
Four gentle yoga classes with me, your yoga teacher â€“ combining pranayama (breathwork), relaxation and meditation.<br /><br />
Delicious vegetarian food and a talk on nutrition and self-care.
Nutrition and yoga practices to support you through perimenopause and beyond
