**Hello, I’m Sophia**<br><br>

I am a coach and founder of Butterfly and Beyond. I have coached team members in the corporate sector for over 20 years, and now have a special interest in coaching to help childless women create fulfilling lives without children.<br>

My Masters research, exploring the experience of coaching in childless women, received an award from the European Mentoring and Coaching Council, UK, for the dissertation with the highest potential for societal benefit.<br>

My mission is to help women who are childless not by choice, reclaim their sense of self and move from simply existing, and just about coping with being childless forever, to truly living whole and fulfilled lives. I promote inclusivity and raise awareness of the unconscious bias that marginalises, isolates and strips people of their self-worth and role within society, including within the media and the workplace.<br><br>

**I believe that no one should feel alone**<br><br>

I grew up with three siblings – the children of parents who emigrated to the UK in the 50’s and 60’s, and remember sometimes feeling different and “other” from my friends because of my ethnicity. Bonded by our “otherness” we were close growing-up, having fun and adventures together. However, when I was thirteen, my brother died by suicide; I was left devastated and family stability was shattered. These events made me a passionate believer that no one should feel alone, the importance of good mental health, and a fierce defender of those who don’t fit neat societal norms.<br><br>

**Living the life unexpected**<br><br>

By the time I reached my early 40s, I had joined a growing band of single, childless women. I had created a rewarding corporate career working in companies which develop therapies to help people with rare diseases. Unwittingly, I had let my time be consumed by my career, and I realised that my hope of meeting someone special, to settle down and have a family, was not going to happen. I tried fertility treatment on my own, and when eventually I was told that I suffered from adenomyosis and that my only option was to go abroad and use donor eggs, I decided to draw the curtains on my dream.<br><br>

**Childlessness and depression**<br><br>

This left me feeling depressed and in a state of grief for the life I had imagined. I found support through an organisation called Gateway Women, and when I was emotionally strong enough, I found an empathetic life coach to help me create a new plan for the future that would teach me how to live a childless life.<br><br>

**Rediscovering my love of coaching and mentoring**<br><br>

Having been introduced to coaching in the early 2000’s, I rediscovered the joy I gained from coaching and mentoring others, and enrolled in a Masters in Coaching and Mentoring to deepen my knowledge and further my practice, during which I developed my own coaching model. Through coaching, I wanted to do for other childless women what others had done for me – help them to regain their confidence and motivation and find their path forward.<br>
Finding no existing research on using coaching for childlessness, I focused my research on the experience of coaching in childless women, which is the first research into coaching in this area.<br><br>

**Thriving when you can’t have children**<br><br>

Recognising the potential for childless women to feel their bodies had failed them, I felt it imperative that my coaching approach was holistic, and incorporated mind, body and spirit.<br><br>

Today, I combine my unique coaching approach with my ten years’ experience as a British Wheel of Yoga teacher with additional training in therapeutic and yin yoga, in a six-month online **[Thrive coaching](/thrive)** program, working with women individually to transform how they view themselves from the inside out, and re-envision their lives with a renewed sense of purpose.<br><br>
