Weekend retreat for childless women [Change text as below, keep the existing image next to this section]
As featured in the British Wheel of Yoga Spectrum magazine, my childless yoga and wellbeing retreats offer a safe space for childless women to come together to recover from the grief of childlessness and rediscover a sense of joy and purpose.

Taught entirely by childless women, and in the company of other childless women, you will be nurtured body and soul in the beautiful setting of The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire.

The next retreat is being held on 17th to 19th September 2021. The weekend of healing and rejuvenation includes:
Four gentle yoga classes with me, your yoga teacher – combining pranayama (breathwork), relaxation and meditation.
Delicious vegetarian food and a talk on nutrition and self-care.
Nutrition and yoga practices to support you through perimenopause and beyond
