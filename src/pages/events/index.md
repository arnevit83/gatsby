      **Weekend retreat for childless women** <br /><br />


      As featured in the British Wheel of Yoga Spectrum magazine, my childless yoga and wellbeing retreats offer a safe space for childless women to come together to recover from the grief of childlessness and rediscover a sense of joy and purpose.<br /><br />


      Taught entirely by childless women, and in the company of other childless women, you will be nurtured body and soul in the beautiful setting of The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire.<br /><br />


      The next retreat is being held on **17th to 19th September 2021**. The weekend of healing and rejuvenation includes:<br /><br />


      * Four gentle yoga classes with me, your yoga teacher â€“ combining pranayama (breathwork), relaxation and meditation.

      * Delicious vegetarian food and a talk on nutrition and self-care.

      * Nutrition and yoga practices to support you through perimenopause and beyond
